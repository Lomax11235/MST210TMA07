This script will produce a diagram for the TMA07 modeling problem, the input required are:

#variables
v_0 initial velocity in m/s
T the thinking time in seoncds (setting to zero will exclude thinking time)
t_c Time interval
v_target the targer velocity for last line (setting to zero will draw all the lines)
